First challenge i did was: https://edabit.com/challenge/HmXdhA9WA9uLnsuiB 
    This was hard for me and after completing it i have found much more simpler solutions, but i think mine is pretty readable which the other solutions arent. I had a very wierd bug that didnt let me get a new Date() when the input for month was 0, but if i tried this outside my function it worked fine, not sure if this is a result of the mapping doing something or what it was about. I fixed this bug by just converting the 0 month to 12.
